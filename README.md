# IT-140-Game

This project was made for IT-140. The goal was to create a text-based game where the player moves through rooms. My game is based on the movie "American Psycho." The player is a police officer investigating the apartment of suspected murder Patrick Bateman. The player can move in any direction to explore the apartment. The goal is to collect an item from all of the rooms and find Bateman before he finds you.
